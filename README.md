## 🎯 How It Works

### Image Detection Algorithm

SnapStream uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach to find images:

1. **DOM Traversal**
   - Scans all `<img>` elements
   - Extracts src, srcset, and data-* attributes
   - Collects natural dimensions

2. **CSS Analysis**
   - Parses computed styles for background-image
   - Extracts URLs from CSS url() functions
   - Detects inline styles and external stylesheets

3. **Picture Elements**
   - Analyzes `<picture>` and `<source>` tags
   - Handles responsive image sources
   - Processes media query variations

4. **Linked Images**
   - Finds `<a>` tags with image extensions in href
   - Pattern matches against common image formats
   - Resolves relative URLs to absolute

### Download Process

```javascript
// Simplified download flow
1. User clicks "Download All"
2. Extension iterates through filtered images
3. Chrome Downloads API saves each file
4. Clean naming: snapstream_example.com_001.jpg
5. Small delay between downloads (100ms)
6. Progress indication via loading state
```
